            This app provides a basic Binomial Tree pricer for pricing American options.
            The analytics calculated are Price, Delta, Gamma and Vega for both Call and Put.
            The "Run" button launches the calculation, and depending on what tab is selected
            it will fill the correspondent output table.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reference implementation is the Generalized Black-Scholes model, which introduces
            the <i>cost of carry</i>. If there is no cost of carry, the carry rate input must
            equal the risk-free interest rate.
        </p>

        <p>
            The technique for pricing American options with a discrete lattice is by means of
            the backward induction. The time from valuation date to expiry is discretized
            using N steps, and the space discretization uses N steps with values that depend
            on the tree type.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general, the space discretization is a logarithmic discretization
            of the underlying space, so an "up" and "down" factors are requested for building the
            tree leaves for each and every time step. Similarly, an up and down probability is
            associated with the two factors. The choice of these 4 variables characterizes the
            tree and defines the accuracy. Usually one chooses this 4 unknowns to match as many
            moments of the underlying distribution as possible, and to have risk-neutral
            probabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two improvements to the usual binomial lattice pricing:
        <ul>
            <li>Smoothing</li>
            <li>Acceleration</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            When the smoothing is enabled, the second last step of the backward induction is
            a Black-Scholes step. This is because in the time discretization the option cannot
            be exercised from maturity to the second last time grid value. This reduces the
            model artifacts, and smoothens out the convergence when the number of nodes increases.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the acceleration is enabled, one of the two option type (call or put) is calculated
            with the Black-Scholes model. This is because, depending on the values of risk-free
            and carry rate, only one of them can be early exercised.
        </p>

        <p>
            The trees implemented are the:
        <ul>
            <li>Cox-Rubinstein-Ross</li>
            <li>Neutralized Jarrow-Rudd</li>
            <li>Tian</li>
            <li>Leisen-Reimer</li>
            <li>Joshi</li>
        </ul>
        All these trees have been extensively studied in
        <a href=http://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/2591884/170.pdf>this</a> paper.
